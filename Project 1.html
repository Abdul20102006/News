    <p class="text">How it all started</p> 
    <img class="img_1" src="Rectangle2.png">
    <p class="text_2">On 18 December 2018, Amber Heard publishes an op-ed in The Washington Post titled: “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change.” In it, she writes in part: “Like many women, I had been harassed and sexually assaulted by the time I was of college age. But I kept quiet — I did not expect filing complaints to bring justice. And I didn’t see myself as a victim. “Then two years ago, I became a public figure representing domestic abuse, and I felt the full force of our culture’s wrath for women who speak out.” Depp isn't mentioned by name in the op-ed. The op-ed would later become the basis of the $50m defamation lawsuit filed by Depp naming Heard as a defendant.</p>
    <div class="Two">
        <p class="text_3">The suit said that Heard "is not a victim of domestic abuse, she is a perpetrator," and denied that Depp ever abused her. Instead, the suit said that Heard's allegations were part of an "elaborate hoax to generate positive publicity" for the actress.</p>
        <p class="text_4">In 2019, Depp sued Heard for $50 million for defamation over the WaPo article</p>
